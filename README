This web script searches the current directory for template files. It will then ask
questions based on XML found in the template file, andthen insert the info at the
appropriate places in the template.

Fair warning, the script does 0 error checking/validation. Do not put it on a public
webserver or you will likely be hacked :)

See the file example.tpl for an example.

It's very short and raw. I wrote it as I couldn't find anything better online that would
fill my needs. Feel free to improve it!
